This repo outlines the objectives for the Ops 301: VPN Setup
## Objective
### VPN Setup
- Build a site-to-site VPN tunnel between the office router (virtual machine) and the home company's central server (virtual machine)
- Alter at least one parameter compared to what was performed in class (e.g. router used, VPN protocol used, introducing a cloud component, etc.)
- Ensure that the VPN connection is secure, reliable, and allows for encrypted data transfer.
- Demonstrate successful access to a file server, Active Directory, or other network resource on the other end of the tunnel.
